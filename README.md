## HOTEL RESERVATION PROJECT

Consider the following scenario:

Your boss, a hotel manager, requests a report on all reservations made between the third quarter of 2017 and the end of 2018. The report must include information on the booking activity for each segment, the month-by-month booking activity, the most expensive and fully booked room, and more. If you work in a hotel, your boss may ask you to answer one of the practical questions mentioned above. I decided to use my Power BI skills to work on the report as long as it could be completed accurately, quickly, and in an organized manner.

### ABOUT THE DATASET

The hotel reservation data set is a CSV file that was downloaded from Kaggle @Hotel Reservations Dataset | Kaggle. It has 19 columns and 36,275 rows, including the following information: booking id, number of adults, number of children, weekends, weeknights, type of meal plan, reserved parking space, room type, lead time, and arrival (year, month, and date),. Data can be imported from different sources, including Excel spreadsheets, SQL Server databases, and cloud-based sources. The CSV file was loaded into Power BI after connecting to a data source and transformed using the Power BI Query Editor (this is where data cleaning is done).
